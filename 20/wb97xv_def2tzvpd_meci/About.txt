This folder contains the input files for the MECI optimization carried out using geomeTRIC which calls Q-Chem for single-point energies and gradients. 
The closed-shell and diradical electronic states are generated by using constrained DFT as an initial guess followed by unconstrained SCF.
The Q-Chem output files correspond to the optimized MECI geometry.
meci_optim.log and meci_optim.xyz contain the output trajectory of the geometry optimization, terminating in the optimized structure.
